## Other resources (unofficial)

- Videos are available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImOU7ZysEH4&list=PLct8iNZXls-BMU7aleWoSoxgD8OFFe48W) and constitute a good first introduction to Neper.
- [Phon](https://phon.readthedocs.io): insert interface elements and export to Abaqus or OOFEM. *Note: interface elements can be inserted directly in Neper using `-interface cohesive`.*
- [Neper2CAE](https://github.com/ngrilli/Neper2CAE) and [PyCiGen](https://github.com/ngrilli/PyCiGen): generate a columnar grain-growth polycrystal, insert interface elements and export to Abaqus (hex elements)
